# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

This project was a refresher on React.Js fundamentals that were all used to create a Calculator. A small project that itself is not the most complex but really dove into React.Js going into what goes into the project and being more comfortable with the framework!
